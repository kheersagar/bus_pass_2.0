# Bus_pass_2.0


# INTRODUCTION 

In my university, we have a concept of a Bus Pass in order to use the transportation facility of the university.

But to get your Bus Pass you need to take out the print of the payment receipt and carry a photograph and reach the office before 4 pm, then only you can have your pass ready, But sometimes students are busy or forgot to bring a photograph or authorized person is not available. Even after everything is in place some students act lazy and give excuses while bus pass checking is going on.

After you have got your pass ready you need to carry the pass every day you never know when checking for bus pass starts. And if you forgot any day you will be considered doing unethical practices since students do not have anything to prove them innocent they will be found guilty.

So, I thought let's digitalize this process and developed this application named Show Bus Pass, Where you can apply for a Bus pass from anywhere, and since you carry your mobile everywhere you have your pass in your pocket.

# Package
It is a combination of three Applications:

Student's App where students can apply and track the bus pass status.

Admin's App where the admin receives the request and checks the details and approves or declines the request.

Validator's App only authorized persons can use the facility and validate the bus pass shown by the student.
